# The Rust Programming Language - Building a Multithreaded Web Server

[Project Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

Here is the plan to build the web server:

1. Learn a bit about TCP and HTTP.
2. Listen for TCP connections on a socket.
3. Parse a small number of HTTP requests.
4. Create a proper HTTP response.
5. Improve the throughput of our server with a thread pool.
